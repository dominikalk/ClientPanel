# ClientPanel
I made a web app that you log into and it contains clients and their balances as part of a Udemy course

You can view the web app via: https://clientpanelprod-dd77f.firebaseapp.com

I made this web app using the angular framework as part of a Udemy course.

It is the accumulation of all the knowledge i have learnt about Angular.

To run the web app run these in the CLI:

npm install
#Installs all the dependancies (You must have node package manager installed for this to work)

ng serve --open
#Compiles the code and opens index.html in the browser

(ctrl + c to end)
